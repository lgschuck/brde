## [What are the ITIL 4 Management Practices?](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-are-the-itil-4-management-practices)

[ITIL^®^ 4](https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/itil) contains 34 management practices to help organisations provide effective service delivery across the value chain.

While previous versions of ITIL focused on IT services, ITIL 4 expands its management practices to also include culture, technology and data management. This reflects an overall change in ITIL 4, away from process-dominant thinking and towards a diverse and dynamic way of operating.

There are three categories of ITIL 4 management practices, which we will look at in-depth in this blog:

-   **General management practices**, which apply across the organisation for the success of the business and the services it provides.

-   **Service management practices**, which apply to specific services that are being developed, deployed, delivered and supported.

-   **Technical management practices**, which are adapted from technology management domains for service management purposes.

### **General management practices**

This section contains 14 management practices:

#### **1. Architecture management**

This practice helps organisations manage the often complex way in which their organisational architecture relates to various parts of the business.

It provides the principles, standards and tools to help manage changes in a structured and agile way.

#### **2. Continual improvement**

Organisations must be able to align their processes and services with changing business needs.

The continual improvement practice helps them achieve this. It ensures that organisations identify opportunities for improvement within services, service components, practices or other parts of service management.

#### **3. Information security management**

This practice relates to the way an organisation protects its sensitive information from misuse. Specifically, information security management looks at ways to prevent breaches of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.

In this context, confidentiality refers to information being viewed by only by authorised parties, integrity to information being accurate, and availability to information being accessible when necessary.

#### **4. Knowledge management**

This practice helps organisations improve the way that they use data. It focuses on the convenience, effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge and data use.

#### **5. Measurement and reporting**

To make good decisions and continually improve systems, organisations must conduct evidence-based research.

This practice provides a framework for doing that, recommending risk assessments and the collection of relevant data.

#### **6. Organisational change management**

This practice helps organisations implement the changes recommended during the continual improvement process.

It emphasises the human aspect of change management and the lasting benefits that can be had if the challenges and opportunities of individuals are accounted for.

#### **7. Portfolio management**

This practice ensures that the organisation has the right combination of programs, products and services to achieve its goals.

It also accounts for the organisation's funding and resource constraints.

#### **8. Project management**

This practice helps organisations oversee their ongoing projects and ensure that they are delivered successfully.

It addresses the way projects are planned, delegated, monitored and maintained. It also addresses the relationships between stakeholders and aims to keep those involved in the project motivated.

#### **9. Relationship management**

For projects to be successful, organisations must establish and nurture the relationships between stakeholders. This practice does do by helping organisations identify, analyse, monitor and continually improve relationships.

#### **10. Risk management**

This practice helps organisations understand and address risks. There are countless ways that problems could materialise, and it's essential that they are spotted as soon as possible to prevent disruption, financial consequences and sustainability issues.

#### **11. Service financial management**

This practice supports the organisation's strategies and plans by ensuring that financial resources and investments are used efficiently.

This practice helps foster those relationships, focusing on creating opportunities for collaboration and identifying ways to make improvements.

#### **14. Workforce talent management**

This practice helps organisations put talented and skilled people in the right roles. It focuses on the planning, recruiting, onboarding and training of employees.

It also looks at the way organisations evaluate the performance of employees and how to develop succession planning.

### **Service management practices**

This section contains a further 17 management practices:

#### **15. Availability management**

With this practice, organisations can ensure that the availability of products and services meets the customer's needs. Those needs should have been agreed upon at the outset of the project.

The objective of this practice is to mitigate the negative impact of disruptive incidents. It helps organisations identify ways of restoring normal service operation as quickly as possible.

It also addresses the regulatory and contractual requirements related to IT assets.

#### **21. Monitoring and event management**

With this practice, organisations can systematically observe services and service components, and record and report selected changes.

They can do this by identifying and prioritising infrastructure, services, business processes and information security events. The practice also establishes the responses to these events.
